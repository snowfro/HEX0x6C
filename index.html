Welcome to <a href="http://users.dimi.uniud.it/~massimo.franceschet/HEX0x6C/EtherCoil/index.html">EtherCoil</a>, a generative art piece I designed for the <a href="https://www.artblocks.io/">Art Blocks</a> project. EtherCoil is reading in real-time the block hashes of Ethereum blockchain and using them to forge artworks shaped as colored intertwined coils. Here are some <a href="http://users.dimi.uniud.it/~massimo.franceschet/HEX0x6C/EtherCoil/index.html">coils</a> generated in real-time.</p> 

<p>If you would like your own custom EtherCoil follow the instructions below: 
</p>

<ol>
<li>get an <a href="https://www.interfacetoken.com/">Standard Interface Token</a> for the <a href="https://www.artblocks.io/">Art Blocks</a> project. Notice that your token has a unique hash associated with it;</li>
<li>send 0.01 ETH to the contract address below (or use the QR code above): <p style = "text-align: center;"><em>0xd5027a93d556b9c4d07db2c9ef6624de041ec7a3</em></p>
</li>
<li>once the transaction is processed, the QR code above will be replaced with a coil design: watch the hashes above the design and when you see the hash that corresponds to your Interface Token press the letter "s" on your keyboard to download the artwork  (write <a href="mailto:massimo.franceschet@gmail.com">me</a> if you accidentally missed your own design!).</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that in order to interact with the project you must send the 0.01 ETH from an Ethereum account where you own an Interface Token. To request a free token visit <a href="https://www.artblocks.io/">Art Blocks</a>  and click the "Request a Free Interface Token" box! Tokens can only be held by Ethereum addresses that you own the private key for, so unfortunately this project will not react to transactions from a Coinbase or exchange account (use, for instance, <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a> on desktop or <a href="https://www.cipherbrowser.com/">Cipher</a> on mobile).</p>


<p>Since you own the hash that corresponds to the EtherCoil you own the generated artwork, so by sending 0.01 ETH to the contract address you're not only supporting my work and the whole Art Blocks project,  but also purchasing a 100% unique work of digital generative art!
